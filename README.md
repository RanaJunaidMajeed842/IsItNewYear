# IsItNewYear

So here is the world's simplest website's source code that I have created it has only one heading that says NO or Yes.
Let me explain what it is in actual? It is a simple dynamic website, its behavior changes weather it is New year or not. This is heading will be Yes if it is new-year today (01-01) .
If you visit this web page on New year then this 'NO' will be changed to 'YES' .I have created this using #django which is a back-end framework of python.
It is actually a clone of a real world website i.e. https://isitchristmas.com/ it will tell you weather today is Christmas or not.
